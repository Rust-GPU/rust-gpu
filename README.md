# `üêâ rust-gpu`

**Rust as a first-class language and ecosystem for GPU graphics & compute shaders**

## Current Status üöß

Note: This project is still heavily in development and is at an early stage.

Compiling and running simple shaders works, and a significant portion of [the core library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/index.html) also compiles.

However, many things aren't implemented yet. That means that while being technically
usable, this project is not yet production-ready.

## Example

![Sky shader](docs/assets/sky.jpg)

```rust,no_run
use glam::{Vec3, Vec4, vec2, vec3};

#[spirv(fragment)]
pub fn main(
    #[spirv(frag_coord)] in_frag_coord: &Vec4,
    #[spirv(push_constant)] constants: &ShaderConstants,
    output: &mut Vec4,
) {
    let frag_coord = vec2(in_frag_coord.x, in_frag_coord.y);
    let mut uv = (frag_coord - 0.5 * vec2(constants.width as f32, constants.height as f32))
        / constants.height as f32;
    uv.y = -uv.y;

    let eye_pos = vec3(0.0, 0.0997, 0.2);
    let sun_pos = vec3(0.0, 75.0, -1000.0);
    let dir = get_ray_dir(uv, eye_pos, sun_pos);

    // evaluate Preetham sky model
    let color = sky(dir, sun_pos);

    *output = tonemap(color).extend(1.0)
}
```

## Getting help

For questions and comments, we use [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/Rust-GPU/rust-gpu/discussions) to keep conversations organized and searchable. This also makes it easy to escalate relevant topics to GitHub issues if needed. We do not have an official chat room.

## Background

Historically in games GPU programming has been done through writing either HLSL, or to a lesser extent GLSL and WGSL. These are simple programming languages that have evolved along with rendering APIs over the years. However, these languages have failed to provide mechanisms for dealing with large codebases, and have generally stayed behind the curve compared to other programming languages.

In part this is because it's a niche language for a niche market, and in part this has been because the industry as a whole has sunk quite a lot of time and effort into the status quo. While over-all better alternatives to both languages exist, none of them are in a place to replace HLSL or GLSL. Either because they are vendor locked, or because they don't support the traditional graphics pipeline. Examples of this include CUDA and OpenCL. And while attempts have been made to create language in this space, none of them have gained any notable traction.

Our hope with this project is that we push the industry forward by bringing an existing, low-level, safe, and high performance language to the GPU; namely [Rust](https://rust-lang.org). And with it come some additional benefits that can't be overlooked: a package/module system that's one of the industry's best, built in safety against race-conditions or out of bounds memory access, a wide range of tools and utilities to improve programmer workflows, and many others!

### Embark

This project was originally created and supported by the folks at
[Embark](https://www.embark-studios.com/). We thank them for their foresight and
contributions.

Embark wanted to streamline their internal development with a single great language,
build an open source graphics ecosystem and community, facilitate code-sharing between
GPU and CPU, and most importantly: to enable their (future) users, and fellow
developers, to more rapidly build great looking and engaging experiences.

## Project scope

The scope of this overall project is quite broad, but is in multiple stages

- `rustc` compiler backend to generate [SPIR-V], plugging in via `-Z codegen-backend`.
  - This is the same mechanism that [rustc_codegen_cranelift](https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift) and [rustc_codegen_gcc](https://github.com/antoyo/rustc_codegen_gcc) use.
  - Currently only [SPIR-V] support is planned, [Vulkan](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan_(API)>)'s open compiler target
  - Possible a future version could support [DXIL](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/blob/master/docs/DXIL.rst) (the target for DirectX) or [WGSL](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/tree/main/wgsl) (the WebGPU shading language that's bijective with SPIR-V)
- [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/) and [crates.io](https://crates.io) support to develop and publish SPIR-V crates

## Process

We use this repo as a monorepo for everything related to the project: crates, tools, shaders, examples, tests, and design documents. This way, we can use issues and PRs covering everything in the same place, cross-reference stuff within the repo, as well as with other GitHub repos such as [rspirv](https://github.com/gfx-rs/rspirv) and [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) itself.

## Backwards compatibility, breaking changes and deprecation

Right now because the project is in an early state of development, we might introduce temporary changes as stop-gap measures, or implement features or APIs that might not work exactly in a way we end up liking. Therefore it is expected that some (if not most) of the user facing code will change and evolve over time. At the moment this means that we make no guarantees about backwards compatibility and have no formal deprecation model in place. Effectively meaning that currently we only support building from source with the latest `main` branch in our repository. We appreciate our early adopters and would ask them to evolve their code along with ours.

## Structure

There are a few different components to this repo:

- [rfcs](docs/src/rfcs) for in-depth discussion and specs.
- [rustc_codegen_spirv](crates/rustc_codegen_spirv) for the compiler itself.
- [spirv-std](crates/spirv-std) for GPU intrinsics, types, and other library items used by GPU crates.
- [spirv-builder](crates/spirv-builder) for a convenient way of building a GPU crate in a CPU build.rs file.
