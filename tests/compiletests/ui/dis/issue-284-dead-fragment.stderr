error: fragment shader `main_fs` produces no output
  |
  = help: fragment shaders must write to output parameters to produce visible results
  = note: use complete assignment like `*out_frag_color = vec4(r, g, b, a)` instead of partial component assignments
  = note: partial component assignments may be optimized away if not all components are written
  = note: to disable this validation (e.g. for testing), use `--allow-fragment-no-output`
